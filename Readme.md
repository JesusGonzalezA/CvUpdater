# CvUpdater
> ðŸš¨ **Warning**: under development (proof of concept)

*CvUpdater* is an app to automatically update your curriculum vitae from linkedin.s

## Context
### Problem
I have to many places where I have to update my curriculum: LinkedIn, my latex version of the curriculum, my personal webpage...
Usually, I browse on Linkedin and I post there all my information.
LinkedIn does not provide an API endpoint to retrieve all my information. I could use the generated CV from LinkedIn, but I want to personalize it and upload other sites.

### Solution
Using a webscrapping solution to retrieve the information from LinkedIn. Then, create a json file that could be used by other app to update my curriculum on other sites.
